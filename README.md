# Senator Finder
This was an exercise in using Javascript with an external API. 

I use Javascript to listen for a selected state in the HTML, and then Ajax to pull data from https://www.govtrack.us/api/v2/role?current=true and then output senators, outputting the respective state's senators to the HTML div.
